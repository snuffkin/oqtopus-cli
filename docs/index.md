## Overview

**OQTOPUS CLI** is a command line interface for setting up and operating a local
OQTOPUS backend environment.

The CLI provides a single `oqtopus` command for the common lifecycle of a local
backend: create an environment, install backend component releases, start,
stop, and restart services, inspect status, and clean up unused installations.
It is designed to make OQTOPUS backend operation feel closer to familiar
developer tools such as package managers and service managers, while keeping
the underlying configuration files available for users who need to edit them.

With OQTOPUS CLI, users can:

- create a backend environment from the official template;
- install and update backend components such as `engine`, `tranqu`, and
  `gateway`;
- start, stop, and restart managed backend services including `core`, `sse_engine`,
  `mitigator`, `estimator`, `combiner`, `tranqu`, and `gateway`;
- check process status and backend environment information;
- keep installed component versions isolated under the local data directory;
- prepare runtime directories such as logs, PID files, and `sse_work` for local
  execution.

For v1.0.0, the CLI targets Linux and macOS local backend workflows. Windows
support, cloud-oriented commands, and the future Rust implementation are planned
as later work.
